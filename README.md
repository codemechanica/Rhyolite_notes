# Rhyolite_notes

the features the we need to implement before our first official release of the app are:-

- cloud syncing of the documents
- saving the data as markdown files instead of json
- vault like implementation similar to obsidian
- Opening any markdown files with our app
- add more commands
- implement more themes

### thats all for the first release

- I am planning on more features too like, converting the markdown to a simple html website that users can self host. for example someone writes documentations for a project in rhyolite and they want to make a website from it, rhyolite will have export options that can export the file as pdf, html, or a webapp
